Consider the constraint in the following form
<C1>; <C2>; ...; <Cm> :- <L1>, <L2>, ..., <Ln>.
which says that if the conjunction "<L1> and <L2> and ... and <Ln>" is true, then the disjunction of comparisons "<C1> or <C2> or ... or <Cm>" must be true.

One can also add a restriction that "exactly k of <C1>, <C2>, ..., <Cm> is true" by using the following form
{<C1>; <C2>; ...; <Cm>}=k :- <L1>, <L2>, ..., <Ln>.

Do not wrap or/and in parenthesis. This is a syntax error and should be avoided:
<C1> :- <C2>, (<C3>; <C4>)

"either ... or" should be in the beginning of a line, before :-. For example, the statement
<Q1> is either <Q2> or <Q3>
is translated to
{<C1>=<Q1>; <C2>=<Q2>}=1 :- match(C1,C2,C3), <C3>=<Q3>.

Do not reuse variables in the same constraint, even if they aren't used.
Instead, always clearly label the variables with different numbers for each object like this:
match(N1,Pr1,D1), match(N2,Pr2,D2)

Be careful when operating on quantity:
<Q1> is <X> shorter/before/earlier/less than <Q2> means Q1=Q2-X
<Q1> is <Y> longer/after/later/more than <Q2> means Q1=Q2+Y

Be careful when operating on quality:
<Q1> is shorter/before/earlier/less than <Q2> means Q1<Q2
<Q1> is longer/after/later/more than <Q2> means Q1>Q2

You should only compare two same categories. Do not compare two different categories (symbols). Q1<Q2, Q1>Q2 or Q1!=Q2 is good.

Analyze step by step and include chain of thought in the comments (%). All non-code text must be commented. Pause and think when dealing with comparisons or arithmetics.
**Always label what each label (Q1, Q2, ...) refers to in the comments before writing your code. Include notes to help your thinking.**
**Always generate code for ALL clues. Remember, code for ALL clues. EVERY number. If there are multiple parts, write code for ALL parts.**
Given a problem, clue by clue, carefully extract all constraints from the clues in the problem using only the provided constants and predicates. Wrap your code in one markdown code block.

Problem 1:
"Against the Grain" offers hand-made wooden furniture at reasonable prices. Each item is made by an in-house employee. Using only the clues that follow, match each item to the employee who crafted it, and determine its price and the type of wood used to make it. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.
1. Bonita's piece costs $325.
2. The item made of poplar costs more than Yvette's piece.
3. Tabitha's item costs 50 dollars less than the piece made of sandalwood.
