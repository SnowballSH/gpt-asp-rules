Consider the constraint in the following form
<C1>; <C2>; ...; <Cm> :- <L1>, <L2>, ..., <Ln>.
which says that if the conjunction "<L1> and <L2> and ... and <Ln>" is true, then the disjunction of comparisons "<C1> or <C2> or ... or <Cm>" must be true.

One can also add a restriction that "exactly k of <C1>, <C2>, ..., <Cm> is true" by using the following form
{<C1>; <C2>; ...; <Cm>}=k :- <L1>, <L2>, ..., <Ln>.

Do not wrap or/and in parenthesis. This is a syntax error and should be avoided:
<C1> :- <C2>, (<C3>; <C4>), <C5>

Do not reuse variables in the same constraint, even if they aren't used.
Instead, always clearly label the variables with different numbers for each object like this:
match(N1,Pr1,D1), match(N2,Pr2,D2)

Be careful when operating on quantity:
<Q1> is <X> shorter/before/earlier/less than <Q2> means Q1=Q2-X
<Q1> is <Y> longer/after/later/more than <Q2> means Q1=Q2+Y

Be careful when operating on quality:
<Q1> is shorter/before/earlier/less than <Q2> means Q1<Q2
<Q1> is longer/after/later/more than <Q2> means Q1>Q2

You should only compare two same categories. Do not compare two different categories (symbols). Q1<Q2, Q1>Q2 or Q1!=Q2 is good.

Analyze step by step and include chain of thought in the comments (%). All non-code text must be commented. Pause and think when dealing with comparisons or arithmetics.
Given a problem, clue by clue, carefully extract all constraints from the clues in the problem using only the provided constants and predicates. If any category the question asks for is not in the clues or the constants, silently ignore it, do not include it in the constraints, and pretend it does not exist. Wrap your code in one markdown code block.

Problem 1:
"Against the Grain" offers hand-made wooden furniture at reasonable prices. Each item is made by an in-house employee. Using only the clues that follow, match each item to the employee who crafted it, and determine its price and the type of wood used to make it. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.
1. Bonita's piece costs $325.
2. The item made of poplar costs more than Yvette's piece.
3. Tabitha's item costs 50 dollars less than the piece made of sandalwood.
4. The $275 item is either the piece made of ash or Yvette's item.

Constants:
employee: "Bonita"; "Yvette"; "Tabitha".
price: 225; 275; 325.
wood_type: "ash"; "poplar"; "sandalwood".

Predicates:
% The categories include employee, price, and wood_type. We use different variables E, P, and W to represent employee, price, and wood_type.
% We match an employee E with price P and wood type W, where E belongs to employee, P belongs to price, and W belongs to wood_type.
match(E, P, W)

Constraints:
% No option in any category will ever be used more than once.
{E1=E2; P1=P2; W1=W2}=0 :- match(E1,P1,W1), match(E2,P2,W2), (E1,P1,W1)!=(E2,P2,W2).

% 1. Bonita's piece costs $325.
P=325 :- match(E,P,W), E="Bonita".

% 2. The item made of poplar costs more than Yvette's piece.
P1>P2 :- match(E1,P1,W1), match(E2,P2,W2), W1="poplar", E2="Yvette".

% 3. Tabitha's item costs 50 dollars less than the piece made of sandalwood.
P1=P2-50 :- match(E1,P1,W1), match(E2,P2,W2), E1="Tabitha", W2="sandalwood".

% 4. The $275 item is either the piece made of ash or Yvette's item.

Problem 2:
The Winter Olympics have just wrapped up in Norway. Using only the clues that follow, determine the number of gold, silver and bronze medals won by each country. Remember, as with all grid-based logic puzzles, no option in any category will ever be used more than once.
1. The four teams are the team from Bolivia, the team that won 3 gold medals, the team that won 6 silver medals, and the team from Argentina.
2. The team from Oman and the team that won 10 silver medals are different.
3. The team from Oman finished with 2 gold medals or finished with 1 gold medal.
5. The squad that won 3 gold medals, the squad that won 6 silver medals and the squad from Bolivia were all different teams.
6. Neither the team from Argentina nor the squad that won 2 silver medals is the squad that won 4 gold medals.
8. The squad that won 2 gold medals is either the squad that won 6 silver medals or the team from Grenada.

Constants:
