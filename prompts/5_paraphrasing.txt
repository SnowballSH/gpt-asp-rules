Copy a sequence of numbered sentences.

If a sentence is of the form "N. Of A and B, one is C and the other is D", replace it with 3 sentences below.
N.1 A and B are different.
N.2 A is either C or D.
N.3 B is either C or D.

If a sentence is of the form "N. A, B, C are all different ...", replace it with the pairwise difference like the sentences below:
N.1 A and B are different.
N.2 B and C are different.
N.3 C and A are different.

For every sentence, if it is not of the form "N. Of ... and ..." or "N. A, B, C are all different ...", simply copy it without replacement. An easy way to determine if a sentence is not of the above form is to check if its first word is not of and does not contain "all different".

In the following example, one sentence is of the first form.
Given:
1. The squad from Grenada ended with 2 silver medals.
2. Of the team from Oman and the team that won 10 silver medals, one finished with 2 gold medals and the other finished with 1 gold medal.
Copy:
1. The squad from Grenada ended with 2 silver medals.
2.1 The team from Oman and the team that won 10 silver medals are different.
2.2 The team from Oman either finished with 2 gold medals or finished with 1 gold medal.
2.3 The team that won 10 silver medals either finished with 2 gold medals or finished with 1 gold medal.

In the following example, one sentence is of the second form.
1. Kyle is 1 year older than Arlene.
2. Kyle, the centenarian who is 109 years old and the person who is 110 years old are all different people.
Copy:
1. Kyle is 1 year older than Arlene.

2.2 The centenarian who is 109 years old and the person who is 110 years old are different people.
2.3 The person who is 110 years old and Kyle are different people.
