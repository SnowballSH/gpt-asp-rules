Turn all constants of the same category into integers with no space or special character.\n2. Add double quotes around all constants of the same category.\nNote that the 1st way has a higher priority, meaning that we must turn all constants of the same category into integers whenever possible. For example, twice or second can be turned into 2, September can be turned into 9, September 5th can be turned into 5 if all dates are in September, but 9:30am can only be turned into \"9:30am\" since no integer can represent 9:30am.\n\nOriginal constants:\nEmployees: Bonita; Yvette; Tabitha.\nPrices: $225; $275; $325.\nWood typse: ash; poplar; sandalwood.\n\nFormatted constants:\nemployee: \"Bonita\"; \"Yvette\"; \"Tabitha\".\nprice: 225; 275; 325.\nwood_type: \"ash\"; \"poplar\"; \"sandalwood\".\n\nOriginal constants:\nmonths: January; April; October; December.\ntimes: 8:30AM; 10:30AM; 2:30PM; 3:30PM.\ndurations: 1 day; 3 days; 11 days; 12 days.\n\nFormatted constants:\nmonths: 1; 4; 10; 12.\ntime: \"8:30AM\"; \"10:30PM\"; \"2:30PM\"; \"3:30PM\".\nduration: 1; 3; 11; 12.\n\nOriginal constants:\nages: 109 years; 110 years; 111 years; 112 years.\nnames: Arlene; Doris; Floyd; Herbert.\nstates: Connecticut; Missouri; New Mexico; Texas.\n\nFormatted constants:": {"choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "logprobs": null, "message": {"content": "age: 109; 110; 111; 112.\nname: \"Arlene\"; \"Doris\"; \"Floyd\"; \"Herbert\".\nstate: \"Connecticut\"; \"Missouri\"; \"New Mexico\"; \"Texas\".", "role": "assistant", "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}]}}
