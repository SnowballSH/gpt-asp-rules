1. The Vorckin impact crater is 125 meters wide.
2. The 150 meters wide one is either the Ordovician impact crater or the Permian impact crater.
3. The Ordovician impact crater is 25 meters wider than the Jurassic impact crater.
4. The Triassic impact crater is either the Ormagh impact crater or the 150 meters wide one.
5. The Cersay impact crater was formed during the Jurassic period.
